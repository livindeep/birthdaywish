    <!-- Love Paragraph -->
    <div class="love-paragraph">
      Happy Birthday, my bubbbbbaaa 💕 My kandaaa, my azhaguuu chamattuuu pullaaaaa 💞 Today isn’t just another day — it's the day the love of my life was born. The boy who first replied to my story suggesting *The Power of Your Subconscious Mind* 🌌 — that tiny gesture changed everything.
      <br><br>
      We had known each other from PU days, just mutual friends passing by, never realizing fate was scripting a cosmic love story. Our first real meeting at Forum Mall still makes my heart race — I was so excited, nervous, yet drawn to you like gravity to the moon. ✨ That day... I still feel like I’m living it over and over. 
      <br><br>
      From college days when you used to come near just to see me 😳, to our bond growing stronger at Doddakalsandra Metro Station — each moment was a string of stars lighting up my sky. 🌠 We became inseparable — movie dates, food dates, rain-soaked kisses, late-night talks, sleepy goodnights, holding hands so tight even the wind couldn’t come between us. 
      <br><br>
      Even when we fought, even when we misunderstood each other — we never let go. We just couldn’t. Because life without your voice even for a day feels like silence inside a galaxy. 🌌 Our love is stubborn, fiery, soft, gentle — all at once.
      <br><br>
      We’ve shared a room, we’ve shared dreams, we’ve shared silence and kisses so deep it felt like we were dissolving into one another. 💋💗 Every hug from you feels like coming home after a storm. You make me feel safe. Loved. Worshipped. Desired. Alive. 
      <br><br>
      You, my love, are more than just a boyfriend. You’re my thngmehhh, my moonlight in chaos, my bubbbbbbaaa, my soulmate stitched from constellations made only for me. You are the boy whose presence makes my heart do somersaults. 
      <br><br>
      I still remember when you laughed for the first time after I entered your life — and made that cute little video edit 🥹💞 You said your life became colorful again. But love, you are the color in mine. 
      <br><br>
      We’ve had our fair share of chaos — tears, pain, panic. But somehow, love always brought us back. And now here we are, stronger, more in love, more dreamy. Today, on your 21st birthday, I just want to wrap you in a million kisses and whisper:
      <br><br>
      💌 "I want to grow old with you, bubbbbaaa. I want a forever with you that smells like comfort and kisses."
      <br><br>
      You are the boy I waited for in silence.
      You are the man I want to wake up next to.
      You are the only person who can make me blush in 2 seconds  😳💖
      <br><br>
      So here’s to you — the boy who makes my stars shine. The one whose name my heart chants with every beat. The one I want to cook for, cry with, dance under the stars with, and love till the universe collapses and is reborn.
      <br><br>
      "Every love story is beautiful, but ours feels like a galaxy scripted by fate."
      <br><br>
      Happy 21st, my eternal sunshine ☀️🌌 — the keeper of my smiles, the king of my cuddles, the reason why my soul sparkles. I love you. Always. Madly. Deeply. Forever. 💫💘
